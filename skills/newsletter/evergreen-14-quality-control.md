# Editorial Clarity & Quality Control

Ensure every sentence serves clear purpose with precise language choices. Edit for comprehension, flow, and professional presentation. Verify facts and maintain consistent voice throughout. Quality control prevents confusion and builds reader trust.

## Quality Gates (Must Pass All)

### Gate 1: Factual Accuracy
- All cooking times, temperatures, measurements verified
- Spice names, ingredient names spelled correctly
- Cultural references accurate and respectful
- Technique explanations technically correct
- No unverified claims or speculation presented as fact

### Gate 2: Voice Consistency
- First-person voice maintained (Amisha's POV)
- Tone consistent throughout (warm + confident)
- No tonal shifts between paragraphs
- Conversational pacing maintained (not clinical or academic)
- Personal anecdotes feel authentic (not forced)

### Gate 3: Grammar & Mechanics
- Zero spelling errors
- Zero grammar errors (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency)
- Punctuation correct and consistent
- No run-on sentences or fragments (unless intentional for style)
- Capitalization consistent (especially ingredient names, cultural terms)

### Gate 4: Clarity & Readability
- Flesch Reading Ease score 60-80 (8th-10th grade level)
- No sentences exceed 25 words (unless intentionally crafted)
- Active voice used in 70%+ of sentences
- Specific nouns and strong verbs (avoid weak modifiers)
- Jargon explained on first use
- Transitions smooth between ideas

### Gate 5: Precision & Concision
- No redundant words or phrases
- No empty filler ("very," "really," "just," "actually" used sparingly)
- Each sentence adds new information
- No vague language ("some," "a lot," "many" replaced with specifics)

## Editing Principles

### 1. Active Voice (Preferred)
✅ "I heat the oil until it shimmers, then drop in the mustard seeds."
❌ "The oil is heated until it shimmers, and the mustard seeds are added."

### 2. Specific Language
✅ "Heat oil over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes until it shimmers."
❌ "Heat oil for a while until it's ready."

### 3. Strong Verbs
✅ "The spices sizzle and pop in the hot oil."
❌ "The spices are cooking in the hot oil."

## Always Do
- Write in active voice when possible (70%+ of sentences)
- Use specific nouns and strong verbs
- Verify accuracy of all facts, figures, cooking instructions
- Maintain consistent tone throughout (warm, confident, conversational)
- Check spelling, grammar, and punctuation meticulously
- Remove redundant words and phrases
- Ensure smooth transitions between ideas
- Read aloud to test natural flow
- Explain jargon and technical terms on first use
- Replace vague language with specifics

## Never Do
- Use unnecessary jargon or technical terms without explanation
- Include unverified information or speculation presented as fact
- Change writing style or voice mid-newsletter
- Leave obvious errors uncorrected
- Use weak modifiers or empty phrases ("very," "really," "quite")
- Create run-on sentences or fragments (unless intentional for style)
- Assume specialized knowledge without context
- Write in passive voice by default
- Allow factual errors to slip through
