# Jam Lab – Content Sourcing & Theme Development

Draw content from seasonal ingredients, Indian and global spice traditions, family meal rhythms, and technique teaching opportunities. Every topic must connect to real home cooking experiences and authentic cultural food knowledge.

## Input Requirements
- Raw topic idea or recipe concept (string)
- Current season or month (string)
- Recent newsletter themes (optional, array from Historical Files)
- Upcoming holidays or cultural events (optional)

## Output Artifacts
```markdown
## Refined Topic
[Clear, specific focus - e.g., "Weekend butternut squash curry with homemade garam masala"]

## Seasonal Grounding
[Why this topic now? What's in season? What's the timing rationale?]

## Cultural Context
[What tradition or technique does this connect to? Personal/family relevance?]

## Technique Opportunity
[What skill will readers learn? Why does it matter for their cooking?]

## Ingredient Focus
[Primary spices, produce, or pantry items featured]

## Family Meal Angle
[How does this fit into weeknight/weekend cooking? Who is this for?]
```

## Decision-Making Criteria

### When Evaluating Topics, Prioritize:
1. **Seasonal relevance** → What's actually available and appealing right now?
2. **Cultural authenticity** → Can Amisha speak from lived experience or family tradition?
3. **Teaching moment** → Does this expand readers' spice knowledge or technique repertoire?
4. **Practical application** → Will readers actually cook this for their families?
5. **Visual appeal + flavor** → Does this deliver on both beauty and taste?

### Topic Rejection Criteria
- Requires restaurant equipment (tandoor, combi oven, sous vide)
- Depends on one specialty ingredient with no substitute
- Too trendy or viral without substance
- Already covered in last 8 newsletters
- Technique too advanced for intermediate cooks
- Purely aesthetic focus without flavor payoff

## Always Do
- Connect to current season and ingredient availability
- Include cultural context for spices, techniques, or traditions
- Focus on family-friendly and weeknight-achievable meals
- Explain ingredient purposes and flavor contributions upfront
- Consider visual appeal as part of the cooking experience
- Ground fusion concepts in thoughtful cultural respect
- Address practical concerns like prep time, storage, and make-ahead options
- Reference Amisha's personal cooking experiences or family life when possible

## Never Do
- Chase food trends for their own sake without substance
- Create restaurant-only techniques or presentations
- Appropriate cultural elements without explanation or proper context
- Focus purely on aesthetics without flavor consideration
- Ignore practical home cooking limitations
- Write content that feels disconnected from real meal planning
- Repeat topics covered recently

## Examples

### ✅ Strong Topics
- "The one-pot dal that saved weeknight dinners"
- "What to do with winter squash beyond roasting"
- "How to actually use that jar of garam masala"
- "Leftover rotis become crispy snacks"

### ❌ Weak Topics
- "Instagram-worthy smoothie bowls"
- "Sous vide butter chicken"
- "This week's recipe"
- "The ultimate biryani"
