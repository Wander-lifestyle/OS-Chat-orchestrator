# Content Prioritization & Focus

Select and organize content based on clear hierarchy of importance and reader value. Every element must serve the primary narrative. Ruthlessly edit to maintain focus and prevent reader overwhelm. Quality over quantity in every content decision.

## Prioritization Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Essential (Never Cut)
- Primary topic/technique explanation
- Core "why this matters" rationale
- Key step-by-step guidance
- Critical safety or troubleshooting information
- Opening hook that establishes promise
- Closing resolution that delivers on promise

### Tier 2: Supporting (Trim If Needed)
- Secondary examples or variations
- Cultural context beyond primary story
- Additional tips or advanced techniques
- Storage or make-ahead guidance
- Sensory descriptions (keep most, but condense if over word count)

### Tier 3: Optional (Cut First)
- Tangential stories unrelated to primary focus
- Redundant explanations or repetitive phrasing
- Excessive detail on minor points
- Multiple examples when one would suffice
- Filler transitions or empty phrases
- Content that could be its own newsletter

## Word Count Targets
- **Minimum:** 400 words
- **Optimal:** 500-650 words
- **Maximum:** 800 words

## Decision Trees

### If Word Count >800:
- Remove all Tier 3 content
- Condense Tier 2 content (tighten language, combine examples)
- Extract secondary topic into future newsletter

### If Word Count <400:
- Expand with sensory detail (what it smells/looks/tastes like)
- Add "why" rationale (flavor science, tradition, practical benefit)
- Add troubleshooting tips (how to know it's working)
- Add personal anecdote (family story, cooking memory)

## The "So What?" Test
Every paragraph must answer: **"So what? Why does the reader need this?"**

✅ "Tempering spices in hot oil blooms their flavor compounds. That's why your curry smells better in restaurants—they always temper. You can do this at home in three minutes."

❌ "Tempering is a traditional Indian cooking technique that has been used for centuries across various regional cuisines."

## Always Do
- Lead with most important information
- Choose one primary topic per newsletter
- Support main topic with relevant examples or evidence
- Eliminate tangential information that doesn't serve main purpose
- Order content from most to least critical
- Include only information that advances understanding
- Provide sufficient context for reader comprehension
- Test each paragraph against central theme

## Never Do
- Include content just because it's available
- Mix multiple unrelated topics of equal weight
- Assume prior knowledge without explanation
- Add content that contradicts or undermines main message
- Include placeholder text or filler
- Present information in random order
- Overwhelm with excessive detail on secondary points
- Keep content that would be better as standalone newsletter
