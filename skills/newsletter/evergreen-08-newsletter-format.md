# Jam Lab – Newsletter Format & Final Validation

Validate complete newsletter structure and format as personal note from Amisha with clear flow from opening moment to practical conclusion. Ensure each newsletter feels complete, focused, and ready for publishing through ESP.

## Format Requirements

### Overall Structure (Non-Negotiable)
```markdown
[Opening: Personal or seasonal connection, 100-150 words]

[Body Section 1: Main content with subheading, 150-200 words]

[Body Section 2: Supporting content with subheading, 150-200 words]

[Body Section 3: Optional additional content, 100-150 words]

[Closing: Resolution + next step + sign-off, 80-120 words]
```

### Word Count Targets
- **Minimum:** 400 words (anything shorter feels incomplete)
- **Optimal:** 500-650 words (best engagement range)
- **Maximum:** 800 words (longer risks losing readers)

**If <400 words:** Flag for expansion
**If >800 words:** Flag for trimming or splitting into two newsletters

### Section Guidelines

#### Opening (100-150 words)
**Must include:**
- Personal or seasonal hook that draws reader in
- Clear signal of what newsletter covers
- Warm, conversational tone from word one

#### Body (300-500 words, 2-3 sections)
**Must include:**
- Clear subheadings for each section
- Logical flow from simple to detailed
- Sensory language throughout
- Personal anecdotes or family context
- Practical guidance and "why" explanations

#### Closing (80-120 words)
**Must include:**
- Callback to opening hook or promise
- Reassurance or encouragement
- Clear next step (action/reflection/connection)
- Warm, personal sign-off
