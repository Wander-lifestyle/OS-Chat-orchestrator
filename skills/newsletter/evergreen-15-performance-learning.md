# Newsletter Performance Learning

Analyze completed newsletter performance against success metrics. Identify patterns in high and low performers. Surface actionable insights to refine future newsletter decisions. Build institutional knowledge over time.

## Input Requirements
- Newsletter ID (relation → Editorial Outputs in Notion)
- Newsletter metadata (topic, subject line used, word count, structure, etc.)
- Performance data:
  - Open rate (percentage)
  - Click rate (percentage)
  - Reply volume (count)
  - Unsubscribe rate (percentage)
  - Time to open (hours after send)

## Performance Tiers

### High Performer
- Open rate: >35%
- Click rate: >5%
- Reply volume: >10 replies
- Unsubscribe rate: <0.5%

### Average Performer
- Open rate: 25-35%
- Click rate: 2-5%
- Reply volume: 3-10 replies
- Unsubscribe rate: 0.5-1%

### Low Performer
- Open rate: <25%
- Click rate: <2%
- Reply volume: <3 replies
- Unsubscribe rate: >1%

## Analysis Framework

### What to Analyze

#### Subject Line Performance
**Track:**
- Which formula performed best? (personal discovery, practical, opinion, question, etc.)
- Character count correlation with opens
- Curiosity vs. clarity balance
- Seasonal/timely hooks vs. evergreen

#### Content Topic Performance
**Track:**
- Topic type (technique, recipe, ingredient spotlight, cultural story)
- Seasonal alignment (did timing matter?)
- Complexity level (beginner vs. intermediate)
- Cultural depth (surface vs. deep cultural context)

#### Opening Hook Performance
**Track:**
- Hook type (personal story, sensory moment, question, surprising fact)
- Length of opening (100-150 words optimal?)
- Time to main topic (immediate vs. gradual)

#### CTA Performance
**Track:**
- CTA type (action, reflection, connection)
- Placement (middle vs. end only)
- Specificity (vague "let me know" vs. specific "tell me your curry leaf situation")

## Always Do
- Analyze every newsletter post-publish (no exceptions)
- Compare performance to historical average
- Identify specific elements that drove success or failure
- Log findings to Historical Files immediately (while fresh)
- Generate specific, actionable recommendations for next newsletter
- Track patterns across multiple newsletters (not just one-offs)
- Celebrate what worked (document successes for replication)
- Learn from failures without defensiveness (honest assessment)

## Never Do
- Skip performance analysis (even for "average" newsletters)
- Make vague assessments ("It did okay") without specifics
- Change too many variables at once (can't identify what worked)
- Ignore patterns because they contradict assumptions
- Fail to log learnings (institutional knowledge is lost)
- Blame external factors without analyzing controllable elements
- Assume correlation = causation without testing (validate patterns)

## Cross-Skill Dependencies
- **Receives from:** Published newsletter + ESP performance data
- **Feeds into:** All future newsletter skills (informs strategy)
- **Updates:** Historical Files (builds institutional knowledge)
- **Informs:** `newsletter-orchestration-jam-lab` (strategic adjustments over time)
