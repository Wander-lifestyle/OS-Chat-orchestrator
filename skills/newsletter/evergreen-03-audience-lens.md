# Jam Lab – Audience Lens & Validation

Write for home cooks who want to expand their flavor horizons while keeping cooking practical for real life. Address readers as capable individuals who appreciate learning but need guidance that works in actual kitchens with actual families.

## Validation Gates

### ✅ PASS Criteria
- Skill level: Intermediate or confident beginner
- Active cooking time: ≤45 minutes weeknight, ≤90 minutes weekend
- Specialty ingredients: <3 items, all with substitutions provided
- Equipment: Standard home kitchen (stove, oven, basic pots/pans)
- Servings: Scalable for families (4-6 people or easily halved)

### ⚠️ REVISE Criteria
- Technique is advanced BUT can be scaffolded with clear explanation
- One specialty ingredient with no substitute BUT framed as aspirational + workaround provided
- Cooking time >45min weeknight BUT can be broken into make-ahead steps
- Recipe is complex BUT can be simplified without losing essence

### ❌ STOP Criteria
- Requires restaurant equipment (tandoor, immersion circulator, professional wok burner)
- Multiple specialty ingredients without substitutes
- Technique requires professional training or years of practice
- Active cooking time >2 hours without break points
- Cannot be made family-friendly (too spicy, weird textures, adult-only)

## Audience Profile

### Who They Are
- Intermediate to confident beginner home cooks
- Cooking for families (partners, kids, extended family)
- Interested in expanding flavor horizons (especially Indian spices)
- Time-constrained but willing to invest in weekend projects
- Real kitchens: standard equipment, not professional setups
- Value both learning and practical outcomes

## Always Do
- Assume intermediate to confident beginner skill level

- Respect reader intelligence while providing clear guidance

## Never Do

- Focus on appearance over flavor and practicality
- Use vague instructions that leave readers guessing
- Underestimate or condescend to reader capabilities
