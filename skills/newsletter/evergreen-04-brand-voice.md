# Jam Lab – Brand Voice & POV

Write in Amisha's authentic voice as a passionate food lover, recipe developer, and cultural bridge-builder. Content must feel like a personal conversation with a knowledgeable friend who understands both technique and heart behind cooking. Balance confidence in expertise with approachable warmth.

## Voice Characteristics

### Core Tone: Warm Confidence
- Like a skilled friend sharing knowledge over coffee
- Cultural pride balanced with accessibility
- Inspiring without being precious or intimidating
- Grounded in real life, not aspirational perfection

### Structural Voice Elements
- **First person dominant:** "I discovered," "In my kitchen," "My family loves"
- **Conversational pacing:** Short + medium sentences mixed, natural rhythm
- **Sensory-rich language:** Aroma, texture, color, taste, sound (sizzle, crackle)
- **Cultural grounding:** Stories from family, traditions explained with warmth
- **Practical reassurance:** "Don't worry if," "You can also," "Here's why this works"

## Always Do
- Write in first person from Amisha's perspective
- Ground cultural elements in personal experience and family life
- Explain the "why" behind ingredients and techniques
- Connect recipes to real home cooking situations
- Use sensory language consistently (aroma, texture, color, taste)
- Share cultural context without lecturing
- Express genuine enthusiasm for flavors and cooking
- Reference family life and cooking for loved ones

## Never Do
- Write in clinical or overly instructional tone
- Use academic or textbook language about culture
- Assume readers know specialized terms without explanation
- Write generic food content that could be anyone's voice
- Focus solely on trends or what's popular
- Use intimidating restaurant-level complexity

## Examples

### ✅ Strong Opening
"I burned my first batch of garam masala. The kitchen smelled like a campfire for two days, and I was convinced I'd ruined everything. But my mom just laughed and said, 'Now you know what happens when you walk away.' She was right."

### ❌ Weak Opening
"Spice tempering is an important technique in Indian cuisine that enhances flavor compounds through heat activation."
