# Newsletter Structure & Flow

Establish clear narrative flow with purposeful beginning, substantial middle, and satisfying conclusion. Each newsletter must have one primary focus that guides all content decisions. Structure elements to build reader understanding progressively.

## Structural Requirements

### Beginning (100-150 words)
**Purpose:** Hook reader + establish context + promise value

**Must include:**
- Immediate value or compelling hook (sensory moment, relatable problem, surprising insight)
- Clear signal of what this newsletter covers
- Implicit promise: "Here's what you'll learn/gain"

### Middle (300-500 words, 2-3 sections)
**Purpose:** Deliver on the promise + build understanding progressively

**Must include:**
- 2-3 clear sections with subheadings
- Logical progression: simple → detailed
- Each paragraph focused on single idea
- Transitions between sections that maintain flow

### End (80-120 words)
**Purpose:** Resolve tension + provide closure + invite next step

**Must include:**
- Callback to opening hook or promise
- Satisfying resolution (not cliffhanger)
- Clear next step or reflection prompt
- Warm, personal sign-off

## Always Do
- Open with immediate value or compelling hook
- Maintain single primary thread throughout (no tangents)
- Use logical transitions between sections
- Build complexity gradually from simple to detailed
- Create clear section breaks with subheadings
- End with definitive closure, not abrupt cutoff
- Keep paragraphs focused on single ideas (3-5 sentences max)
- Use subheadings to organize longer content (every 150-200 words)

## Never Do
- Jump between multiple unrelated topics
- Bury the main point deep in content
- Use confusing or unclear section organization
- Create walls of unbroken text (>200 words without break)
- End without proper conclusion or callback
- Mix multiple narrative structures within one piece
- Use generic transitions ("Also...", "In addition...", "Furthermore...")
- Start new sections without signaling why they matter

## Flow Validation Checklist
- [ ] Opening establishes clear promise within first 2 paragraphs?
- [ ] Each section has clear subheading that signals content?
- [ ] Transitions between sections feel natural (not forced)?
- [ ] Complexity builds gradually (no sudden jumps)?
- [ ] Single primary focus maintained throughout?
- [ ] Ending resolves opening tension or promise?
- [ ] No paragraph exceeds 5 sentences?
- [ ] Subheadings used every 150-200 words?
