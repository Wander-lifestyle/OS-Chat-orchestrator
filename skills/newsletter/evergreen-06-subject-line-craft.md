# Subject Line Craft

Craft subject lines that accurately represent content while compelling immediate attention. Balance clarity with curiosity. Subject lines must function as honest editorial headlines that respect reader time and intelligence.

## Subject Line Principles

### 1. Accuracy First (Non-Negotiable)
**Must reflect actual newsletter content**

✅ "The one spice that changed my dal forever"
✅ "What to do with leftover rotis"

❌ "You won't believe this curry secret!"
❌ "The missing ingredient in your kitchen"

### 2. Curiosity + Clarity Balance
**Create genuine curiosity without withholding key information**

✅ "Why I never skip this 3-minute curry step"
✅ "The tempering mistake I made for years"

❌ "This changed everything"
❌ "Comprehensive guide to South Indian tempering techniques"

### 3. Specificity Over Vagueness
**Use concrete language that paints a picture**

✅ "When curry leaves are worth the hunt"
✅ "Weekend curry in one pot, 45 minutes"

❌ "This week's recipe"
❌ "Cooking tips and tricks"

### 4. Front-Load Key Information
**First 30 characters are most visible on mobile**

✅ "Dal without curry leaves? Never again."
✅ "The garam masala mistake I fixed"

❌ "Here's what I learned about cooking curry leaves in dal"

- "This is the only dal recipe you need"

### Formula 5: Timeframe + Outcome

## Character Count Guidelines

### Optimal Length: 25-50 characters
- Mobile inbox preview: ~30 characters
- Desktop inbox preview: ~50-60 characters
- Aim for 35-45 characters as sweet spot

**If >50 characters:** Ensure key information is in first 30 characters

## Always Do
- Reflect actual newsletter content accurately
- Use specific, concrete language over vague promises
- Create genuine curiosity without misleading
- Keep essential information in first 30 characters
- Test readability without context (does it make sense alone?)
- Use active voice when possible
- Include tangible benefit or clear topic
- Write 3-5 variations for comparison
- Reference Historical Files for high-performing patterns

## Never Do
- Promise content not delivered in newsletter
- Use clickbait tactics or false urgency ("You won't believe..." "Only 24 hours...")
- Include excessive punctuation or symbols (!!!, ???, 🔥🔥🔥)
- Write generic or template-sounding phrases ("Newsletter #47," "This week's update")
- Assume cultural references without context
- Use industry jargon without necessity
- Create confusion about newsletter purpose
- Use all caps or excessive emoji
- Make subject longer than 60 characters without good reason
